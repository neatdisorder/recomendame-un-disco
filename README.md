### Music Recommendation Page

This is a small website I created that uses HTML forms to return 'taylor-made' recommendatons of albums or pieces of music using YouTube's embedded videos. It's my first project which I've created it a few months ago while taking my first steps in **Javascript**. Texts are in Spanish only.

Although I don't think this is a very important project, I'm currently taking my first steps in **React** and I intend to make a new version for practicing with this library.
